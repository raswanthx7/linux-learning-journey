# Linux Learning Journey – 30 Day Plan

This repository contains my personal notes and practice files from my 30-day Linux learning journey. I'm using Red Hat Linux in a virtual machine to build a strong foundation in system administration and prepare for a future in cloud computing.

Each day’s learning is documented in a separate Markdown file, covering real-world concepts, commands, and examples.

This is a self-paced, hands-on journey toward mastering Linux fundamentals.
