#  How a Computer Boots (Step-by-Step)

## 1. Overview
The boot process is the sequence of steps a computer follows when it is powered on — starting from the **hardware initialization** to loading the **operating system** into memory.

It begins the moment you press the power button and ends when the OS is fully ready to accept user input.

## 2. Step-by-Step Boot Flow (UEFI-Based System)

###  Step 1: Power Supply & Motherboard Activation
- When you press the **power button**, the **Power Supply Unit (PSU)** sends electricity to the **motherboard**.
- The motherboard powers up critical components like:
  - **CPU (Processor)**
  - **RAM (Memory)**
  - **Firmware chip (UEFI or BIOS)**

---

###  Step 2: Firmware (UEFI or BIOS) Starts
- The **firmware** is a small program stored on a **ROM or Flash memory chip** on the motherboard.
- Its job is to **start hardware initialization** and **control the first boot steps**.
- It performs a **POST (Power-On Self-Test)**:
  - Checks CPU, RAM, keyboard, and storage devices.
  - If any critical hardware fails → boot stops, and you see an error/beep code.

---

###  Step 3: Locate Boot Device (Disk)
- After POST, the firmware looks for a **bootable disk**.
- Depending on system type:
  - **BIOS** → looks for **MBR (Master Boot Record)**.
  - **UEFI** → looks for **EFI System Partition (ESP)** formatted as **FAT32**.

---

###  Step 4: Load Bootloader
- The **bootloader** is the first small piece of code that knows how to start an OS.
- On Linux, this is usually **GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader)**.
- UEFI reads the `.efi` file (like `grubx64.efi`) from the **EFI System Partition** and loads it into **RAM**.

---

###  Step 5: Bootloader Loads the OS Kernel
- Once in memory, the **bootloader** locates the **Linux kernel** (e.g., `/boot/vmlinuz`).
- It also loads a small **initramfs (initramfs = a small temporary filesystem that helps Linux find and mount the real root filesystem)** — a temporary root filesystem.
- The bootloader passes control to the kernel.

---

###  Step 6: Kernel Initializes Hardware
- The **kernel** takes over control.
- It:
  - Initializes device drivers.
  - Mounts the **real root filesystem** (e.g., `/dev/sda1` formatted with **ext4**).
  - Starts system services and background daemons.

---

###  Step 7: System Initialization (User Space)
- Once the kernel is ready, it starts the **init system** (e.g., `systemd`).
- `systemd`:
  - Mounts file systems.
  - Starts network services.
  - Launches the **login screen** or **shell**.

## 4. Key Components Recap

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **UEFI / BIOS** | Firmware that initializes hardware and finds the boot device. |
| **ESP (EFI System Partition)** | Small FAT32 partition that stores bootloader `.efi` files. |
| **Bootloader (GRUB)** | Loads and starts the OS kernel. |
| **Kernel** | Core of the OS; controls CPU, memory, and hardware. |
| **Initramfs** | Temporary filesystem that helps locate and mount the real root filesystem. |
| **Root Filesystem (ext4)** | Main Linux filesystem that contains `/bin`, `/usr`, `/home`, etc. |

---

## 5. Real-World Notes
- Linux servers and modern systems almost always use **UEFI + GPT**.
- BIOS + MBR is still supported but considered **legacy**.
- If you ever see `/sys/firmware/efi` directory in Linux, it confirms your system uses **UEFI**.
