##  Linux Learning Journey

This repository contains my personal notes and practice files from my **Linux learning journey**.  
I'm using **Red Hat Linux** on a **VMware Workstation virtual machine** for hands-on practice as part of my self-paced journey to build a strong Linux foundation.

##  Daily Documentation

Each day’s learning is documented in a separate Markdown file, including:

-  **Topics I covered**
-  **Key concepts and notes**
-  **Commands I practiced**

This is a **self-paced, hands-on journey** toward mastering **Linux fundamentals**.
