##  30-Day Linux Learning Journey

This repository contains my personal notes and practice files from my **30-day Linux learning journey**.  
I'm using **Red Hat Linux** on a **VMware Workstation virtual machine** for hands-on practice as part of my self-paced journey to build a strong Linux foundation.

Each dayâ€™s learning is documented in a separate Markdown file, including:

-  **Topics I covered**

This is a **self-paced, hands-on journey** toward mastering **Linux fundamentals**.
